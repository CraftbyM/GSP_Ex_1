    "# Assertions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assertions** are a language feature in Python that enable programmers to verify that a certain condition is met. This feature is particularly useful for ensuring that variables are within an appropriate range for further computations. For example, in a function that converts temperatures, an assertion can be used to check that the input value is not below absolute zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, `assert` statements function similarly to an electrical fuse: if the input current is too high, the fuse blows to protect the appliance that follows. Likewise, if input values are outside an expected range, the `assert` statement triggers an error, halting the program to prevent subsequent code from running with incorrect inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**However**, it's worth noting that there are better, faster, and more elegant solutions available that are also more concise. One such example is the use of the `apply()` method in Pandas' `DataFrame`s. This method allows for the execution of a user-defined function on each row or column of the DataFrame, the behavior of which is determined by the `axis` parameter. Setting `axis=1` applies the function across rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of executing the function in parallel are aggregated into a `pandas.GeoSeries`, which is then returned by `apply()`. This result can subsequently be assigned to a new column or row.

    "### Applying an Anonymous Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For straightforward functions that are concise enough to fit in a single line, it's possible to utilize what's known as a *lambda function* or *lambda notation*. Lambda functions adhere to the syntax `lambda arguments: return-value`, which involves the `lambda` keyword followed by one or more argument names (separated by commas), a colon (`:`), and the expression defining the return value. For instance, a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum would be written as `lambda a, b: (a + b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lambda functions are useful for their brevity and are meant to be used directly where they're defined, providing a convenient way to incorporate simple expressions without the need for defining separate functions. Although prevalent in data science, lambda functions should be used judiciously. As a general guideline, lambda functions are best reserved for cases where the code can comfortably fit on one (short) line.\n",
